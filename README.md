- 👋 Hi, I’m @yusuf-khaan
- 👀 I am a current student pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science with a specialization in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence [IBM] at Shri Ramswaroop Memorial University. Eager to apply my academic knowledge 
     and specialized skills gained from the IBM program, I am well-versed in data science and artificial intelligence technologies. Proficient in programming languages such as Python, Java. I am actively seeking 
     opportunities to gain hands-on experience and contribute to impactful projects in the field. As a motivated and detail-oriented student, I am excited to explore internships that will allow me to apply 
     theoretical concepts in real-world scenarios, furthering my growth in the dynamic field of data science and artificial intelligence.
- 🌱 I'm now engaged in a number of data-driven projects that are aimed at improving my critical thinking abilities and data driven decision-making for stakeholders. 
- 💞️ Collaborating on projects that are data-driven, data-analytical, or data-driven prediction would be a pleasure for me. In addition to contributing to your efforts, I would be happy to share my insights.
